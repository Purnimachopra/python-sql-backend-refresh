"How You Should Explain This in Interviews

If asked:

Why do you use requirements.txt?

You can say:

“It ensures environment consistency by listing project dependencies, 
making the application reproducible across machines and deployment environments.”"

"requirements.txt is not optional in professional work.
It’s a minimum standard, like tests and Git."
